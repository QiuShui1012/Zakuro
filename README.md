## ðŸ“– What's this mod?
Have you ever been bothered by the prompt **'Too Expansive!'** in the anvil while forging equipment?  
Have you ever noticed that the collision box of the end rod and lightning rod is larger than what they should actually have?  
Have you...

There are many inconvenient places in Minecraft, and **this mod** provides some functions to may improve them.
## ðŸ”§ Functions
**Functions** _(also called **Modules** in this mod)_ are fully modular and switchable.You can get a built-in settings screen by installing [ModMenu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) mod.

Some of the functions:
- deleteTooExpensive   
  This module removes the "Too Expensive!" tip on the anvil and keeps the penalty level on the item.

- fixBlocksOutlineShape  
  This module fixes some blocks' outline shape and syncs it to the blocks' model.

- fixZombieReinforcement  
  This module fixes the zombie reinforcement and allows zombies and their variants to spawn clones of themselves, just like Minecraft 1.21.2 version does.
